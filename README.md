# odin-calculator
Created as part of the Odin Project curriculum

**Introduction**
The goal for this project is to combine all of the foundations of JS, HTML, and CSS learned via the Odin Project. 

I took a little gap between the last two projects and this one to practice coding exercises via freecodecamp. I also spent quite a bit of time going beyond the original scope in my last two projects, so this one actually ended up being fairly straight forward. Especially because I decided not to go too far beyond what I was asked to do and focused more on clean code and simple functions.

**Functionality** 

Operates like a simple calculator with options to add, subtract, divide, and multiply. I also included some more advanced functions like factorials, roots, and exponents.

**Process**

I didn't have too much trouble with this project at all. I started by creating the simple mathematical functions and testing them out in the console. Afterwards, I created a grid in HTML/CSS to create the calculator display and buttons. 

Once I got a basic layout, I used event listeners to link the functions to the various buttons, making sure to test each function before moving on to the next one. After I got the basic functions linked, I created the more advanced ones in Javascript and linked them to the appropriate buttons.

Finally, I used CSS to style the calculator into something that looked more like a real calculator. I used colorzilla.com to test out a few different linear gradients for the calculator, display and buttons. Box-shadow is also used on the calculator to really make it look 3D like. 

**Closing thoughts**

I'm quite happy with how this turned out and how long it took! I knocked out the bulk within a day, only coming back to add some styles and update this README. I spent quite a bit of time practicing Object Oriented Programming and Functional Programming in the 2 weeks before starting this project, so I *hope* created something simple and functional. Of course, I do intend on returning in the future to see what can be improved.
